Rewarded Ads are usually full-screen video ads which users can view to receive a reward inside the application, like an additional in-game currency or a health bonus.


Example Usage:

// Callbacks:

private void OnRewardGranted(Enhance.RewardType rewardType, int rewardValue) {
    if (rewardType == Enhance.RewardType.ITEM) {
        writeLog ("Reward granted (item)");

        writeLog ("Reward granted (coins)");
        writeLog ("Reward value: " + rewardValue);
    }
}

private void OnRewardDeclined() {
    writeLog ("Reward declined");
}

private void OnRewardUnavailable() {
    writeLog ("Reward unavailable");
}

if (Enhance.IsRewardedAdReady()) {
    // The ad is ready, show it
    Enhance.ShowRewardedAd (OnRewardGranted, OnRewardDeclined, OnRewardUnavailable);
}

    isBannerVisible = false;

Offer Walls
-----------

Offer Walls show full screen of real world offers (e.g. surveys), usually with a reward offered in return for a completion.


Example usage:

private void OnCurrencyReceived(int amount) {
    writeLog ("Currency received: " + amount);
}

Enhance.SetReceivedCurrencyCallback (OnCurrencyReceived);

if(Enhance.IsOfferwallReady()) {
    Enhance.ShowOfferwall();
}


Methods:

void Enhance.SetReceivedCurrencyCallback(
    Action<int> onCurrencyReceived
)

Specify the function which is called every time the user receives a reward from any offerwall. We recommend that you use this function at the beginning of your appâ€™s logic to be sure the callback is ready as soon as an offerwall sends the reward. This could happen at different times, even right after your app starts! As a parameter, this action will receive an amount of the granted currency (int).
Returns nothing.

Local Notifications

Local Notifications are reminders which show up on your screen after the app becomes inactive for a specific amount of time.

Methods:

void Enhance.RequestLocalNotificationPermission(
    Action onPermissionGrantedCallback,
    Action onPermissionRefusedCallback
)

Request a permission from the user to show local notifications. This won't have any effect on Android devices as you don't need a permission to schedule local notifications there (onPermissionGrantedCallback will be still fired).
Returns nothing.


void Enhance.EnableLocalNotification(
    string title,
    string message,
    int delay
)

Schedule a new local notification, if possible. The notification will persist until you disable it manually. For example, if you set a notification for 60 seconds, it will invoke this notification 60 seconds after the app is closed every time.
Use seconds for delay.

void Enhance.DisableLocalNotification()

Disable any local notification that was previously enabled.


In-App Purchases

    string price = Enhance.Purchases.GetDisplayPrice("my_product", "$5");

    string title = Enhance.Purchases.GetDisplayTitle("my_product", "My Product");

}

private void OnPurchaseFailed() {
    // Failure
}
